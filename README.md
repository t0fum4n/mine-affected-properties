### My Story

Buying a home should be one of the most exciting moments in a person’s life. It’s a major milestone—a decision that shapes the future of a family. For my family, that moment turned into one of stress, fear, and frustration.

I was **excited to return to Warrick County**—a place I have strong connections to and where I looked forward to putting down roots again. When we found the home we wanted in **Chandler, Indiana**, we went through the entire process like any responsible buyer—getting inspections, handling paperwork, and preparing for what we thought would be a **safe, long-term home for our family**.

Then, just **days before closing**, we learned something that changed everything: **A mine had collapsed just 2 blocks away from our new home and worse yet, our home is ON that same mine.**

We weren’t told about this risk during the buying process. No one warned us that our home sat on potentially unstable ground. The **only reason we found out** was because a major mine collapse had already happened nearby, damaging homes and leaving residents uncertain about their future. Being a Warrick County native, I am well aware of the different mining operations throughout the county, but I never would have thought that **MY new home, the one I picked out of all the ones in Warrick County, would be on a mine that is actively collapsing.**

This was a terrifying realization. The idea that our home—our **safe space**—could be at risk of sinking into the ground was **not something we had ever been prepared for**. We had no idea if our **homeowner's insurance** would cover it or not.

When we hesitated, when we asked questions, and when we expressed concerns about backing out of the purchase, we were met with **pressure and even legal threats**. Instead of being given time to make an informed decision, we were **backed into a corner**. We were **forced to decide quickly** under the weight of potential lawsuits and financial consequences.

We ultimately **moved forward with the purchase**, but not because we truly felt safe or confident. We did so out of fear of what might happen if we walked away and what that might do to our family. We were assured we had the proper insurance, so our best bet was to move forward and **work to ensure this never happens to anyone else.**  

In a way, this is a **blessing** to us as we (and many others in the area) **wouldn’t have even known that mine subsidence insurance was needed**. Without that insurance, we could have been left **completely unprotected** if a collapse ever affected our home. That small piece of good fortune doesn’t change the fact that **this is something no homebuyer should ever have to deal with**.

I want to make it clear: **despite this situation, I am fully covered with insurance, and I remain excited to be back in Warrick County.** However, I am also **adamant that no homeowner should ever go through what my family has experienced.**

## Why This Ordinance is Necessary

No one else should have to go through what we did. **Homebuyers in Chandler deserve to know the truth** before committing to the single biggest investment of their lives.

This ordinance is about **fairness, transparency, and protection for homebuyers**. If we had known **from the very beginning** that the house was on a mine, we could have researched, asked the right questions, and made an informed decision—without being backed into a corner.

### This ordinance will:
✅ **Require sellers to disclose mine risks upfront, not at the last minute.**  
✅ **Ensure buyers receive all available evidence of mine-related risks, including past structural assessments and damage reports.**  
✅ **Protect buyers from being pressured into purchasing a home with hidden risks.**  
✅ **Give buyers the ability to walk away if they are not comfortable with the risk.**  
✅ **Hold sellers and real estate agents accountable if they fail to disclose mine-related hazards.**  

Right now, **Chandler is already dealing with the aftermath of a mine collapse** that damaged homes and displaced residents. The town is **applying for FEMA assistance**, but there’s no guarantee that these homeowners will receive the help they need. Some families **may be forced to walk away from homes they’ve lived in for years**—all because they didn’t know the risks when they first moved in.

This isn’t just a **personal issue**—it’s a **community-wide problem** that must be addressed.

## Final Thoughts

I’m pushing for this ordinance because **I don’t want anyone else to experience what my family did**. No one should be **caught off guard days before closing** or feel forced to take on a home with **undisclosed risks**.

Buying a home should be a **fair and informed process**, not a **gamble with your family’s safety and financial future**.

By passing this ordinance, we can help ensure that **every homebuyer in Chandler knows exactly what they’re buying** and that **real estate transactions in our town are conducted with honesty and integrity**.

I **love Warrick County, and I’m grateful to be back**. But I will **fight to make sure that no other homeowner has to deal with what my family has had to go through.**
